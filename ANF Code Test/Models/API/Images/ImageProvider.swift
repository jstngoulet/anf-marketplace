/**
 This class is used to abstract all image loading within the application.
 
 The abstraction layer allows us to not only have a centralzed place for all image
 downloads into image views, howwever, it also allows us to control the animations,
 the cache and even the CDN (if one is added) with ease. Since every image will be
 passed through this ÃŸingle class (through a variety of methods and helpers), This
 centralizes our ability to scale the image managment framework to beyond what is already
 defined in these functions.
